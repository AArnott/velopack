Velopack is a setup / installation framework for cross-platform dotnet applications. Great out-of-the-box development experience, with zero configuration or setup needed. Lightning fast to use, and lightning fast for your users, too.

## Features

- üòç **Zero config** ‚Äì Velopack takes your dotnet build output (eg. `dotnet publish`), and generates an installer, and update package in a single command.
- üéØ **Cross platform** ‚Äì Velopack supports building packages for Windows and OSX, with Linux on the way. No matter your target, Velopack can create a release in just one command.
- üöÄ **Automatic migrations** - If you are coming from [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) or [Clowd.Squirrel](https://github.com/clowd/Clowd.Squirrel), Velopack will automatically migrate your application. Just build your Velopack release and deploy! [Read more.](docs/migrating.md)
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Lightning fast** ‚Äì Velopack is written in Rust for native performance. Creating releases is multi-threaded, and produces delta packages for fast app updates. Applying update packages is highly optimised, and often can be done in the background.

## Getting Started
This is a very simple example of the steps you would take to generate an installer and update packages for your application. Be sure to [read the documentation](docs) for an overview of more features!

1. Install the command line tool `vpk`:
   ```cmd
   dotnet tool install -g vpk
   ```
2. Install the [Velopack NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/velopack) in your main project:
   ```cmd
   dotnet add package Velopack
   ```
3. Configure your Velopack app at the beginning of `Program.Main`:
   ```cs
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
       VelopackApp.Build().Run();
   }
   ```
4. Publish dotnet and build your first Velopack release! üéâ
   ```cmd
   dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained -r win-x64 -o .\publish
   vpk pack -u YourAppId -v 1.0.0 -p .\publish
   ```
5. Add automatic updating to your app:
   ```cs
   private static async Task UpdateMyApp()
   {
       var mgr = new UpdateManager("https://the.place/you-host/updates");

       // check for new version
       var newVersion = await mgr.CheckForUpdatesAsync();
       if (newVersion == null)
           return; // no update available

       // download new version
       await mgr.DownloadUpdatesAsync(newVersion);

       // install new version and restart app
       mgr.ApplyUpdatesAndRestart();
   }
   ```

If you're not sure how these instructions fit into your app, check the example apps for common scenarios such as WPF or Avalonia.
