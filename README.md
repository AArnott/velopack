# Clowd.Squirrel

Squirrel is both a set of tools and a library, to completely manage both installation and updating your Desktop Windows application.

This project is a fork of the library [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows). The main focus here has been to update to more modern tooling, such as upgrading the main libraries to `netstandard2.0`, upgrading the tools to `net6.0`, and adding lots of fixes for dotnet core support.

This library will help you build a `Setup.exe`, integrated (or standalone `Update.exe`) application updater, and release updates to your users very quickly and easily. The `Setup.exe` and `Update.exe` produced by this library are completely dependency free, and can even help you bootstrap/install a runtime of your choice (such as dotnet 5, .net 4.8 or others).

## What Do We Want?

Windows apps should be as fast and as easy to install and update as apps like Google Chrome. From an app developer's side, it should be really straightforward to create an installer for my app, and publish updates to it, without having to jump through insane hoops. 

* **Integrating** an app to use Squirrel should be extremely easy, provide a client API, and be developer friendly.
* **Packaging** is really easy, can be automated, and supports delta update packages.
* **Distributing** should be straightforward, use simple HTTP updates, and provide multiple "channels" (a-la Chrome Dev/Beta/Release).
* **Installing** is Wizard-Freeâ„¢, with no UAC dialogs, does not require reboot, and is .NET Framework friendly.
* **Updating** is in the background, doesn't interrupt the user, and does not require a reboot.

## Quick Start For .NET Apps

1. Install the [Clowd.Squirrel Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clowd.Squirrel/)

2. Add SquirrelAwareVersion to your assembly manifest to indicate that your exe supports Squirrel. 

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <assembly manifestVersion="1.0" xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
     <SquirrelAwareVersion xmlns="urn:schema-squirrel-com:asm.v1">1</SquirrelAwareVersion>
   </assembly>
   ```
   There are also [some](https://github.com/clowd/Clowd.Squirrel/blob/develop/docs/using/custom-squirrel-events.md) more [legacy](https://github.com/clowd/Clowd.Squirrel/blob/develop/docs/using/custom-squirrel-events-non-cs.md) ways to assign a binary SquirrelAwareVersion if you cannot edit your assembly manifest.
3. Handle Squirrel events somewhere very early in your application startup (such as the beginning of `main()` or `Application.OnStartup()` for WPF). 

   ```cs
   public static int Main(string[] args)
   {
       SquirrelAwareApp.HandleEvents(
           onInitialInstall: OnInstall,
           onAppUpdate: OnUpdate,
           onAppUninstall: OnUninstall,
           onFirstRun: OnFirstRun);
           
       // ...
   }

   private static void OnInstall(Version obj)
   {
       using var mgr = new UpdateManager("https://the.place/you-host/updates");
       mgr.CreateUninstallerRegistryEntry();
       mgr.CreateShortcutForThisExe(ShortcutLocation.StartMenu | ShortcutLocation.Desktop);
   }
   
   private static void OnUninstall(Version obj)
   {
       using var mgr = new UpdateManager("https://the.place/you-host/updates");
       mgr.RemoveUninstallerRegistryEntry();
       mgr.RemoveShortcutForThisExe(ShortcutLocation.StartMenu | ShortcutLocation.Desktop);
   }
   
   // ...
   ```
   
   When installed, uninstalled or updated, these methods will be executed, giving your app a chance to add or remove application shortcuts or perform other tasks. 

4. Publish your app (with `dotnet publish` or similar) 
   - If you want your application installer to install your runtime during setup (eg, `net48` or `net6`), you can use the `--framework` option in the next step. This means your installer will be smaller, but may require the internet if your user does not already have the required runtime installed.
   - Otherwise, you wish to ship a self contained app, you must specify `--selfContained=true` option during publish. This means your installer will be larger, but will also work offline and will not need to download or install any additional dependencies.

5. Create a Squirrel release using the `Squirrel.exe` command line tool. 
   The tool can be downloaded from GitHub Releases, or it is also bundled into the [Clowd.Squirrel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clowd.Squirrel/) nuget package. 
   If installed through NuGet, the tools can usually be found at:
   - `%userprofile%\.nuget\packages\Clowd.Squirrel\<Clowd.Squirrel version>\tools`, or;
   - `..\packages\Clowd.Squirrel\<Clowd.Squirrel version>\tools`
   
   Once you have located the tools folder, create a release. Example below with some useful options, but explore `Squirrel.exe -h` for a complete list.
   ```cmd
   Squirrel.exe pack --packName "YourApp" --packVersion "1.0.0" --packAuthors "YourCompany" --packDirectory "path-to/publish/folder"
   ```
   Notes:
   - Custom icons and splash art can be added to your installer using the options `--setupIcon` and `--splashImage`. Splash art can be any kind of image, but will appear animated if a `.gif` is supplied.
   - The same `--releaseDir` (default `.\Releases`) should be used each time, so delta updates can be generated.
   - The package version must comply to strict SemVer syntax. (eg. `1.0.0`, `1.0.1-pre`)
   - A list of supported runtimes for the `--framework` argument is [available here](https://github.com/clowd/Clowd.Squirrel/blob/develop/src/Setup/RuntimeInfo.cpp)
   
6. Distribute your entire `--releaseDir` folder online. This folder can be hosted on any static web/file server, [Amazon S3](docs/using/amazon-s3.md), BackBlaze B2, or even via [GitHub Releases](docs/using/github.md). 
   
   If using CI to deploy releases, you can use the package syncing commands to download the currently live version, before creating a package. This means delta/patch updates can be generated. Complete powershell example:
   ```ps1
   # build / publish your app
   dotnet publish -c Release -o ".\publish" 

   # find Squirrel.exe path and add an alias
   Set-Alias Squirrel ($env:USERPROFILE + "\.nuget\packages\clowd.squirrel\2.6.2-pre\tools\Squirrel.exe");

   # download currently live version
   Squirrel http-down --url "https://the.place/you-host/updates"

   # build new version and delta updates.
   Squirrel pack`
    --framework net6`              # Install .NET 6.0 during setup, if required
    --packName "YourApp"`          # Application / package name
    --packVersion "1.0.0"`         # Version to build. Should be supplied by your CI
    --packAuthors "YourCompany"`   # Your name, or your company name
    --packDirectory ".\publish"`   # The directory the application was published to
    --setupIcon "mySetupIcon.ico"` # Icon for Setup.exe
    --splashImage "install.gif"    # The splash artwork (or animation) to be shown during install
   ```

7. Update your app on startup / periodically with UpdateManager.
   ```cs
   private static async void UpdateMyApp()
   {
      using var mgr = new UpdateManager("https://the.place/you-host/updates");
      var newVersion = await mgr.UpdateApp();
      
      // optionally restart the app automatically, or ask the user if/when they want to restart
      if (newVersion != null) {
         UpdateManager.RestartApp();
      }
   }
   ```
