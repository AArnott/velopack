# Windows Shortcuts
*Applies to: Windows*

By default, during installation Velopack will create a shortcut on the Desktop and in the Start Menu Root. 

It will automatically delete any shortcuts it finds when uninstalling the application.

If you need to create shortcuts in any extra locations, the `Velopack.Windows.Shortcuts` and `Velopack.Windows.ShellLink` classes are provided. 

These classes are provided for legacy reasons, and in general the stability of such functions is not guarenteed.
